## READ FIRST!
This is a simple guideline on how to report an issue in a way that it makes it easier for you and us to reproduce and fix.

### Before you open a new Bug Report you need to check:
* If there is already an open report for your issue.
* Is it a personal or character specific issue?
* Is it a UI or addon issue?

If the answer is **YES** to any of the following statements above you should NOT open a bug report. Please then open an in-game ticket.

### Issue Self Checklist
* Am I using WoW-KOI Client? (If no, then do not open a bug report)
* Did I include the steps to reproduce the problem?
* Did I include the description of how it should work?
* Did I include the description of what is happening?
* Did I include NPC/Item/Spell names (or IDs) from wowhead.com or Armory?
* Have I been descriptive and precise?
* Did I follow the template?

**DO NOT log multiple issues in one (each boss/item/quest must have its own report).**

Please include links to reputable sources to confirm your statements. The acceptable list is:

* [http://www.wowhead.com/](http://www.wowhead.com/)

We will ignore and potentially close issues with links to other server or unacceptable reference.

Now that you have read and understood the rules click on the link below to go to the issues repository:

Remember that if you rush to log a "FAKE" issue you will be delaying the fix of "REAL" issues.

Thank you!
